### Option 1: The "Startup Founder" Vibe (Best for engagement)
**Headline:** Solving the Hostel Hunger Crisis, One Line of Code at a Time. 🚀

I’m excited to share a sneak peek of **Hostel Bites**, a startup I’m building to revolutionize how students order food in our hostel! 🍔

We’ve all been there—late-night cravings, confusing chats for orders, and asking "is the canteen open?". I decided to stop complaining and start building.

**💡 The Solution:** A full-stack web app that brings the canteen to your fingertips. 

**🔥 What’s Live Now:**
✅ **Seamless Ordering**: Browse menu, add to cart, and checkout in seconds.
✅ **Real-time Stock**: No more ordering "Sold Out" items—the app updates instantly.
✅ **Digital Payments**: Integrated Razorpay for cashless transactions.
✅ **Smart Admin Dashboard**: Total control over inventory and delivery timings.

It’s been an incredible journey building this from scratch using **React, Firebase, and Vite**. 

We are deploying the beta version soon! I’d love to hear your thoughts or feature requests. 👇

### Option 2: The "Tech & Product" Focused (Professional)
**Headline:** Building a Scalable Food Delivery Platform from Scratch. 💻📦

I’ve been working on **Hostel Bites**, a comprehensive food ordering application designed to streamline operations for hostel canteens. This isn't just a project; it's a fully functional product targeting real-world efficiency.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
*   **Frontend**: React + Vite (for lightning-fast performance)
*   **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
*   **Payments**: Razorpay Gateway Integration
*   **Deployment**: Vercel

**✨ Key Features Implemented:**
*   **Role-Based Access**: Secure Google Authentication for Students vs. Admins.
*   **Dynamic Inventory**: "Out of Stock" logic automates availability based on orders.
*   **Live Order Tracking**: Students can see if their order is Pending, Prepared, or Delivered.
*   **Admin Controls**: Ability to toggle store status (Open/Later) and manage orders effectively.

I'm treating this as a serious startup endeavor to solve logistics in micro-communities. Check out the screenshots below! 📸
