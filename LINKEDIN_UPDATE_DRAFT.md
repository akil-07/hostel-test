# LinkedIn Post Draft: Hostel Bites v2.0 Update

**Headline:** 🚀 Leveling Up: From MVP to "Pro" – Hostel Bites Gets a Major Glow-Up! ✨

**Body:**

A few days ago, I shared the first version of **Hostel Bites**. But in the world of software, "done" is just the beginning of "better".

I decided to push the boundaries of UI/UX and functionality to make the app feel not just useful, but *premium*. Here is the massive update we just shipped:

🎨 **Aesthetic Overhaul:**
Inspired by the industry giants (Zomato/Swiggy), the UI is now cleaner, faster, and more vibrant.
✨ **Delightful Details:** Added interactive floating background animations (yes, floating burgers! 🍔) and smooth micro-interactions that make the app feel alive.
🌙 **Dark Mode:** Late-night coding sessions need late-night snacking. We added a fully responsive **Dark Mode** that switches themes instantly across the entire app.

💳 **Tech Stack Evolution:**
We moved beyond simple frontend logic.
*   **Payments:** Migrated to **PhonePe** Gateway integration for a seamless, secure payment flow.
*   **Backend:** Spun up a dedicated **Node.js & Express** backend to handle secure transactions and server-side verification.
*   **Database:** Advanced **Firebase Firestore** queries for real-time order tracking.

📊 **Admin Superpowers:**
The dashboard is now a command center.
*   **Analytics:** Real-time revenue tracking and top-selling items visualizer.
*   **Data Management:** Implemented "Soft Delete" & Archiving logic—history is preserved without cluttering the daily view.

It’s been an intense week of refactoring and learning, but seeing the app transform from a "project" to a "product" is worth every bug fix. 🐛➡️🦋
