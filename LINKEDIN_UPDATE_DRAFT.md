# 📱 LinkedIn Post Draft: Mobile-First & Profile Update

**Headline:** 🚀 Crafting the Perfect Mobile Experience: Navigation, Analytics, and a sleek UI Overhaul! 📱✨

**Body:**

User experience isn't just about colors; it's about flow. Today, I took a massive step in transforming the **Hostel Bites** web app into a mobile-first powerhouse that feels just like a native app. 📲

Here’s what I’ve been building:

🚦 **Seamless Mobile Navigation:**
Web apps often struggle on mobile, so I built a **Native-App-Like Bottom Navigation Bar**.
- Quick switching between **Delivery**, **History**, and **Profile**.
- Added a Dynamic **Floating Cart Button** (FAB) that tracks your items as you shop. 🛒

🎨 **UI Polish & Dark Mode Perfection:**
- Fixed critical contrast issues to ensure the app looks stunning in **Dark Mode** (no more white patches!). 🌙
- Implemented responsive header designs that adapt perfectly from desktop to mobile screens using a smart **Hamburger Menu**. 🍔

📊 **Smart Profile & Spending Analytics:**
Students need to track their budget! I built a comprehensive **Profile Dashboard** that features:
- **Spending Tracker:** Real-time calculation of "This Week" vs "This Month" expenses. 💰
- **Transaction History:** An expandable detailed view of every rupee spent, with timestamps and order references.
- **Personalization:** Profile picture uploads and address management stored securely in Firebase.

🛠️ **The Tech Stack:**
Built with **React (Vite)** + **Firebase** + **Node.js**.

It’s all about the details—making the web feel native, responsive, and intuitive.
